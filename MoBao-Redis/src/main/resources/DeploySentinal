# *** IMPORTANT ***
#
# By default Sentinel will not be reachable from interfaces different than
# localhost, either use the 'bind' directive to bind to a list of network
# interfaces, or disable protected mode with "protected-mode no" by
# adding it to this configuration file.
#
# Before doing that MAKE SURE the instance is protected from the outside
# world via firewalling or other means.
#
# For example you may use one of the following:
#
bind 192.168.31.83

redis-sentinel /etc/sentinal/5000.conf
redis-server /etc/sentinal/5000.conf --sentinel

4、检查哨兵状态

redis-cli -h 192.168.31.187 -p 5000

sentinel master mymaster
SENTINEL slaves mymaster
SENTINEL sentinels mymaster

SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster
